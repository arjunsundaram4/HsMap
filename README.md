# Hope-Simpson Map

Hope-Simpson inspired COVID-19 research project
A different way to visualize and analyze COVID-19 cases using various tools such as ReactJS, Tableau, Python, Google Data Sheet and Ubuntu Servers. We created a platform based on modern databases, visualization, web design, virtual machines, signal processing, and data analysis. We analyzed COVID-19 data on our platform based on Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson's perspective and his study of the spread of the influenza virus.
